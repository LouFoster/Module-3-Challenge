# Overview of Project
(As captured from Data Bootcamp Module ) 

A Colorado board of election employee has given you the following task to complete the election audit of a recent local congressional election.

•	The voter turnout for each county

•	The percentage of votes from each county out of the total count

•	The county with the highest turnout


# Project Purpose
This module is to illustrate the use of the programming language Python to: 

•	Create scripts that read, write, and store data from files or in arrays.

•	Perform mathematical operations.

•	Use decision statements, logical operations for complex comparisons, and repetition statements to run code more than once.

•	Produce screen outputs.


By the end of this module, as the assigned Data Analyst, I should be able to show the client the following abilities.

•	Navigate to folders on your computer using the command line.

•	Read and extract data from CSV files.

•	Determine the difference between Python data types, like integers, floating-point decimal numbers, and strings.

•	Perform mathematical operations using data types.

•	Declare variables using different data types.

•	Create and use data structures like lists, tuples, and dictionaries.

•	Create and use decision and repetition statements.

•	Create and use Boolean and logical operators.

•	Write data to an output file and print the file.

# Overview of Election Audit
A Colorado board of election employee has given you the following task to complete the election audit of a recent local congressional election.
•	The voter turnout for each county
•	The percentage of votes from each county out of the total count
•	The county with the highest turnout

Finally, as assigned Data Analyst, I need to provide the clients with a written analysis of the election audit for the election commission, including the new results and a clearly written overview of your methods. As with all written analyses, this will help your audience understand what you did and what they might be able to do with the data you presented.

# Deliverable 1: Election Results Printed to the Command Line (60 points)
Using repetition statements, conditional statements with logical operators, and print statements, print out the candidate and county election results to the command line.

# Deliverable 2: Election Results Saved to a Text File (20 points)
Using your knowledge of writing data to a text file, write the winning candidate results and the county election results to the election_results.txt file.

# Deliverable 3: Written Analysis of the Election Audit (20 points)
Overview of Election Audit: 
A Colorado board of election employee , the Data Analyst, has given you the following task to complete the recent local congressional election audit.
•	The voter turnout for each county
•	The percentage of votes from each county out of the total count
•	The county with the highest turnout
Resources: Data Source: election_results.csv

# Election-Audit Results: 
We created a python script to report our analysis; see the above Screen Print Out. We were tasked with the following Using a bulleted list, address the following election outcomes. Use images or examples of your code as support where necessary.
•	How many votes were cast in this congressional election?
•	Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of total votes for each county in the precinct.
•	Which county had the largest number of votes?
•	Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of the total votes each candidate received.
•	Which candidate won the election, what was their vote count, and what was their percentage of the total votes?

Analysis shows the following 
  
  The analysis of the election shows that:
   
•	There were 369,711 total votes cast in this congressional election.

•	The county results for the precinct:
 
  o	Jefferson cast 10.5% of the vote and 38,855 votes.
 
  o	Denver cast 82.8% of the vote and 306,055 votes.

  o	Arapahoe cast 6.7% of the vote and 24,801.


•	The three candidates were:
  
   o	Charles Casper Stockham
 
   o	Diana DeGette
 
   o	Raymon Anthony Doane

•	Denver county had the largest number of votes.

•	The candidate results were:
  
  o	Charles Casper Stockham recieved 23.0% of the vote and 85,213 votes.
  
  o	Diana DeGette recieved 73.8% of the vote and 272,892 votes.
 
 o	Raymon Anthony Doane recieved 3.1% of the vote and 11,606 votes.

•	The winner of the election was Diana DeGette, who recieved 73.8% of the vote and 272,892 votes.

# Election-Audit Summary: 
This is a very general and useful script that could be used as a template for any future election.

Currently, the program is written to analyze the election_results.csv file by iterating through each row and reading the data in the second and third columns, 'County' and 'Candidate', in order to calculate and print the results. 

The election commission can use the PyPoll_Challenge.py script with some modifications. There are many different ways in which this code can be altered and used with any election results. Another possibility is to read data from additional columns in order to calculate and print further results. This is useful for files containing more information, such as the ballot type or the data on the vote was cast.

In addition, learning Python, reviewing the code, and building a sound script for analysis, I believe as Data Analyst, one can become so focused on a single aspect instead of considering all factors and or variables that one could miss some creative ways to look at the data. For example, many real-world coding programs require mathematical calculations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. To perform these calculations in Python, several arithmetic operators are used, which may sometimes present a slight challenge. Nonetheless, I propose that the election commission can use the PyPoll_Challenge.py script with some modifications.

# Additional Analysis
Further analysis of the election data led to questions on the calculation of the voter turnout for each county that voted in the congressional district. How to calculate the percentage of votes each county contributed to the election. We also asked to determine which county had the largest turnout.



# Election Results
•	The winner of the election was Diana DeGette, who recieved 73.8% of the vote and 272,892 votes.
